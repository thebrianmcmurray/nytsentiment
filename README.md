# New York Times Sentiment Analysis

This repo contains a Jupyter notebook detailing the process used for performing sentiment analysis on over 150 years of front page articles from the New York Times. After having heard many statements regarding the general sentiment and tone of modern news, I decided to take a look at some data to try and visualize the change in the tone of the news throughout the years.

In the Jupyter notebook I have included the code needed to scrape the New York Times' archive API for all news articles from 1852 to 2018, as well as the code to clean the data, perform the sentiment analysis, and generate several visualizations of the data.

# Sentiment Analysis

For the sentiment analysis, the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reason (VADER) tool was used. I had tested using a distilBERT model for sentiment classification, but the VADER tool proved to be far more efficient computationally, and natively provided more grainular output.

# Keyword Extraction

I tested several different methods for identifying the most significant, for both frequency and sentiment, keywords from the positive and negative sentiment classes for each year. TF-IDF yielded undesirable results as it did not take into account sentiment. Instead, a count vectorization was calculated using the CountVectorizer method from the sklearn library. The final metric used to identify the most significant word for each class each year was the product of the word frequency and the individual word sentiment.

Calculating the average or sum sentiment of the articles that contained each word was tested, but required an increase in computational cost and did not yield better results.

# Results

The red reperesents the distribution of negative sentiment articles, gray for neutral, and green for positive. The word in the green and red sections represents the most frequent sentiment significant positive or negative word for that year, respectively.

* There is a gap for 1964 due to the field for print page numbers that year were completely missing.

# Tools Used
* NLTK
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Requests
* Sklearn

# To Do
* Add graph showing sum values of VADER pos, neg, and neu values.
* Add graph showing sentiment distribution by month.
* Test additional sentiment analysis models.
* Test TF-IDF further for keyword extraction.
